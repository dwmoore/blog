## Scopes

The pattern we just reviewed works great when we are dealing with individual
records but what about actions that produce a list? Let's expand our example to 
include an index action that displays different collections of suppliers based on 
similar controls.

{% highlight Ruby %}
class SupplierPolicy
  attr_reader :user, :record

  def initialize(user, record)
    @user = user
    @record = record
  end

  def show?
    user.admin? || record.published?
  end

  def update?
    user.admin? or not post.published?
  end

  class Scope < Scope
    attr_reader :user, :scope

    def initialize(user, scope)
      @user = user
      @scope = scope
    end

    def resolve
      if user.admin?
        scope.all
      else
        scope.where(:published => true)
      end
    end
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}
