Hello there! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is Dave and I enjoy building things. I also enjoy travel, snowboarding,
classic cars, and a good beer with friends.

I do full stack development, mostly for startups. My goto tools are Ruby, Rails, 
JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, and Bootstrap.

I am also the founding member of KnoxRuby, a twice monthly Ruby/Rails meetup and 
co-host of Knoxville's first Rails Bridge workshop.

If you're ever around, hit me up and let's have a pint!

Cheers!
